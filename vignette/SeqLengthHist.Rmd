## Introducton to SeqLengthHist

The `SeqLengthHist` package contains two function: `histSeqLengths` and `getSeqLengths`.

The `getSeqLengths` returns a vector of all sequence lengths in the FASTA file 

The `histSeqLengths` plots a histogram of the sequence lengths in a
FASTA file.  

```{r RSkittleBrewer}
library(SeqLengthHist)
histSeqLengths("./sample.fa")
```
